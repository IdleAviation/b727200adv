This is the Idle Aviation Boeing 737-200 Project. The goal of this project is to create a reasonably accurate simulation of several variants of the aircraft for use in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. The initial version simulated will:

### Boeing 737-200 Advanced

```
Model:  B737-200 Adv
Engine: JT8D-15D
PAX:    136
Nav:    Classic (non-RNAV)
```

Once the above is complete the plan is to 'upgrade' the aircraft with an INS system, and then eventually GPS based navigation equipment, and finally full 'glass cockpit' upgrade with existing Garmin equipment in the simulator. 

### How to contribute

If you would like to contribute to the project, please join our Discord listed above or simply add a feature and make a pull request.

### Who is 'Idle Aviation'?

Flight sim enthusiasts who want interesting airliners in MSFS 2020 who also happen to like the idea of open source and the community getting together to build something cool.

### Neat, will this be STUDY LEVEL!!?!??

That term is dumb. The goal of this, and all Idle Aviation projects, will be to build an aircraft that is reliable enough to fly from Point A to Point B (with a stop at Point C in the middle if you like, who are we to tell you how to fly?) on any of the popular online networks (VATSIM, IVAO, POSCON, PilotEdge etc) without any drama. It will be simulated to the depth that we feel like simulating it to. 

### That's silly, I want everything simulated fully!

Fine, since this is an open source project grab your favorite editor, crank some tunes, and start adding as much simulation depth to this project as you like! We'll happly take the changes. At the moment we're aiming for fun, flyability, and variation so that comes first for those of us that started this project.
